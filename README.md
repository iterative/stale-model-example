This is the project branch that accompanies the [Serving Models with MLEM blog post]().

## Get started

Here's what you need to do to get this project running.

- Clone the repo
- Check out the `mlem-serve` branch with: `git checkout mlem-serve`
- Create a virtual environment with a command like: `python -m venv .venv`
- Install all of the dependencies with : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `dvc exp run` to generate your first experiment

Now you should be able to run the project with [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [MLEM](https://mlem.ai/) already in place.
